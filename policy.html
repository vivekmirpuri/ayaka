    <p>For order cancellations, the order may be canceled before 60 minutes have elapsed since the order was placed. After that time has elapsed, the customer must assume the purchase.

      <p>Japanese food restaurants use many ingredients from the sea. No matter how careful you may be, some restaurant material may come into contact with the item to which the customer is allergic. If you are allergic to any marine ingredient,
          you will be eating at your own risk, since the restaurant is not responsible if a person falls ill or dies from food poisoning.
